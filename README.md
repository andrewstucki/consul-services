# Consul Services

This binary helps run testing services on the Consul Service mesh.

## Example

Boot up the services in the background:

```bash
consul-services -c example/consul-services.yaml -d
# or
consul-services --run -r example --http 3 --external-http 1 -D 3 -d
```

Test the API gateway:

```bash
GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT=$(consul-services get api -k api -f '.NamedPorts.one')
curl localhost:$GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT -H "host: test.consul.local"
```

Test the ingress gateway:

```bash
INGRESS_HTTP_PORT=$(consul-services get ingress -k ingress -f '.Ports[0]')
curl localhost:$INGRESS_HTTP_PORT
```

Test connectivity through the terminating gateway:

```bash
consul-services check http-1-1 http-external-1
```

Open up the admin interface of the API gateway:

```bash
consul-services admin api -k api
```

Check the logs of the API gateway:

```bash
consul-services logs api -k api
```

List all services:

```bash
consul-services list -a
```

Stop the services

```bash
consul-services stop
```

âžœ  consul-services -h

## Catastrophes

If there are any bugs that you are hitting that are leaving processes in an orphaned state (this binary does a lot of child execs, and so does `consul connect` itself), then the easiest way to kill anything this may spin up and get your system back in a normal state (assuming you don't have any instances of `consul` or `envoy` running that you want to keep around) is (on a Mac):

```bash
killall consul; killall envoy; killall consul-services; rm ~/.consul-services.sock
```
