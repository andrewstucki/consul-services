# Consul Services

This binary helps run testing services on the Consul Service mesh.

## Example

Boot up the services in the background:

```bash
consul-services -c example/multi-dc.yaml -d
```

Test the API gateway:

```bash
GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT=$(consul-services get api -k api-gateway -f '.NamedPorts.one')
curl localhost:$GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT -H "host: test.consul.local"
```

Test the ingress gateway:

```bash
INGRESS_HTTP_PORT=$(consul-services get ingress -k ingress-gateway -f '.Ports[1]')
curl localhost:$INGRESS_HTTP_PORT
# and cross-dc mesh routing
curl localhost:$INGRESS_HTTP_PORT -H "host: dc2.consul.internal"
```

Test connectivity through the terminating gateway:

```bash
consul-services check http-dc1-1-1 http-external-1
```

Open up the admin interface of the API gateway:

```bash
consul-services admin api -k api-gateway
```

Check the logs of the API gateway:

```bash
consul-services logs api -k api-gateway
```

List all services:

```bash
consul-services list -a
```

Open up the Consul UI:

```bash
consul-services ui
# and for the second datacenter
consul-services ui -d dc2
```

Generate a bash script that duplicates this environment

```bash
consul-services report
```

Stop the services

```bash
consul-services stop
```

## Usage

```bash
âžœ  consul-services -h
Boots and registers a series of Consul service mesh services used in testing

  admin       Opens the envoy admin panel for a given service.
  check       Checks for one-way connectivity between two services
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  get         Gets a particular service
  help        Help about any command
  list        Lists the services currently running.
  logs        Read logs from a deployed service.
  report      Generates a shell script for a Github report

  ui          Opens up the Consul UI

Flags:
  -c, --config string            Path to configuration file. (default ".consul-services.yaml")
      --consul string            Consul binary to use for registration, defaults to a binary found in the current folder and then the PATH.
  -d, --daemon                   Daemonize the process.
      --datacenter stringArray   Datacenters to deploy into. (default [dc1])

      --external-tcp int         Number of TCP-based external services to register on the mesh.
  -h, --help                     help for consul-services
      --http int                 Number of HTTP-based services to register on the mesh. (default 1)
  -o, --output string            Path to use for output rather than stdout.
  -r, --resources string         Path to a folder containing extra configuration entries to write.
      --run                      Additionally run Consul binary in agent mode.

      --tcp int                  Number of TCP-based services to register on the mesh.

Use "consul-services [command] --help" for more information about a command.

## Catastrophes

If there are any bugs that you are hitting that are leaving processes in an orphaned state (this binary does a lot of child execs, and so does `consul connect` itself), then the easiest way to kill anything this may spin up and get your system back in a normal state (assuming you don't have any instances of `consul` or `envoy` running that you want to keep around) is (on a Mac):

```bash
killall consul; killall envoy; killall consul-services; rm ~/.consul-services.sock
```
